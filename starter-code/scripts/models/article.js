 articles directly on the constructor function. Note: it is NOT on the prototype.
 In JavaScript, functions are themselves objects, which means we can add
 properties/values to them at any time. In this case, we have a key:value pair
 to track, that relates to ALL of the Article objects, so it does not belong on
 the prototype, as that would only be relevant to a single instantiated Article.
